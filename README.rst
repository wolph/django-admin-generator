The Django Admin Generator is a project which can automatically generate
(scaffold) a Django Admin for you. By doing this it will introspect your
models and automatically generate an Admin with properties like:

 - ``list_display`` for all local fields
 - ``list_filter`` for foreign keys with few items
 - ``raw_id_fields`` for foreign keys with a lot of items
 - ``search_fields`` for name and ``slug`` fields
 - ``prepopulated_fields`` for ``slug`` fields
 - ``date_hierarchy`` for ``created_at``, ``updated_at`` or ``joined_at`` fields
